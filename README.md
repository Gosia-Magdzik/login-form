 Project is an interactive form that allows users to log in or sign up if they don't have an account yet.
</div>

 - To handle state management within the application, I utilized the <b><span style="color: #C0E5C8;">useContext</b></span> hook.

 - Designed to be fully <span style="color: #C0E5C8;"><b>responsive</b></span> and optimized for mobile devices.

 - The project includes <span style="color: #C0E5C8;"><b>data validation</b></span> to guide users in correctly filling out the form.
 
 - I implemented The <span style="color: #C0E5C8;"><b>Framer Motion</b></span> library which allows the screen to rotate when transitioning from the login to the sign-up page. 

I'm happy to present this interactive project and hope it proves to be both useful and enjoyable for users.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
